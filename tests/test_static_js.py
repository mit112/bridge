"""The one piece of JavaScript behaviour that a Python suite cannot infer.

`copy.js` used to read `source.textContent`. On a `<pre>` that is the prompt; on
the `<textarea>` Phase 3 replaces it with, it is the **server-rendered** text and
not what the user typed, so Copy would hand over a stale prompt while looking
like it worked. The plan names this specifically, and everything else in Phase 3
that could go wrong has a test, so this should too.

The rest of the front end is asserted structurally from the rendered HTML in
`test_api.py`. This module exists only because `bridgeText`'s contract is a
property of the DOM object it is handed, which no amount of HTML inspection
reveals. It runs the real file under `node` with a minimal stub rather than
adding a JS test framework, a bundler, or a dependency.
